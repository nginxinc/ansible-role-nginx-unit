# Ansible NGINX Unit Role

This role installs NGINX Unit on your target host.

**Note:** This role is still in active development. There may be unidentified issues and the role variables may change as development continues.

## Requirements

### Ansible

*   This role is developed and tested with [maintained](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html) versions of Ansible base. When using Ansible base, you will also need to install the following collections:

    ```
    **Note:** You can alternatively install the Ansible community distribution if you don't want to manage individual collections.
*   Instructions on how to install Ansible can be found in the [Ansible website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#upgrading-ansible-from-version-2-9-and-older-to-version-2-10-or-later).
